Upon searching online for Arbitrary Code Execution related to ImageMagick I found this vulnerability:
https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/security/advisories/GHSA-8rxc-922v-phg8

![[cat identify_images.png]]
- Navigating to **/opt/app/static/assets/images** I decide to recreate the **POC**

The first step is to set up a **netcat** listener to catch the reverse shell:
![[nc listener.png]]

Next I create a shared library with a reverse shell payload embedded into it:
![[gcc.png]]

Everything within `system('  ');` will be executed by **root**:
![[root.png]]
- Our **nc** listener successfully catches the reverse shell

Voila! We found the **root.txt** flag:
