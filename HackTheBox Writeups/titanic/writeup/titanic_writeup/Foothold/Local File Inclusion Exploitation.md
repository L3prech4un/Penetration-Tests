Returning to the http://titanic.htb/, we will attempt to gain an initial foothold by finding valuable credentials that may be present.

With our newly discovered path: **/home/developer/gitea/data/gitea/conf/app.ini** 
We will use curl to steal the config file **app.ini**:![[app.ini.png]]
- Ran the command `curl http://titanic.htb/download?ticket=/home/developer/gitea/data/gitea/conf/app.ini -o app.ini`
	- And Voila! We successfully exploited the ticket generator's vulnerable code to download a file we were never meant to access.
- Concatenating **app.ini** immediately gives us interesting information.
  1. The first thing I notice is a line of code: `PASSWORD_HASH_ALGO = pbkdf2` ![[hash algorithm.png]]
		- This may prove useful if we find any passwords that need to be cracked and we don't know their encryption algorithm
  2. We also find an **sqlite3** database created by **root**: ![[sqlite3 database.png]]
	  - Interestingly enough, it also lists the path to said file. Consequently we can also download this file to attempt to gain more information.
	  - `PASSWD = ` suggests that the db contain no security measures, making it easy to analyze its contents

Again using curl:![[curl gitea.db.png]]
- `curl http://titanic.htb/download?ticket=/home/developer/gitea/data/gitea/gitea.db -o gitea.db`
- Now I will proceed to analyze the **gitea.db** file using the following command: `sqlite3 gitea.db`
	- ![[gitea.db tables.png]]
		- The **user** table looks promising, so let's start there:
		  1. Running the following command, `PRAGMA table_info(user);`prints out the column names within the **user** table![[column names.png]]
		  2. We can see the table has a lot of promising column names. With this in mind we will move onto the next section
